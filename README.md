## Introduction

The Mushroom Classifier is a machine learning project that focuses on accurate mushroom identification. Using scikit-learn models and Python in a Jupyter notebook, this project analyzes and processes a dataset from Kaggle to train a model that can classify mushrooms as edible or poisonous. The goal is to provide a reliable and accessible tool for mushroom enthusiasts and foragers.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project comes from Kaggle and contains information on various mushroom species, including features such as cap shape, cap color, gill attachment, and more. The dataset was thoroughly analyzed and preprocessed to ensure the best possible model fitting.

Dataset source: [Kaggle Mushroom Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/mushroom-classification)

## Setup & Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the Mushroom Classifier on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/Briankim254/mushroom-classifier.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory using `cd mushroom-classifier`
3. Create a virtual environment for the project using `python3 -m venv venv`
4. Activate the virtual environment using `source venv/bin/activate` (for Unix-based systems) or `venv\Scripts\activate` (for Windows)
5. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. Launch Jupyter notebook using `jupyter notebook`

The Jupyter notebook will open in your default web browser, and you can now access and interact with the Mushroom Classifier notebook.

## Usage

1. Open the `Mushroom_Classifier.ipynb` file in the Jupyter notebook interface
2. Execute the cells in sequence to load the dataset, perform data preprocessing, and train the model
3. Examine the model evaluation results and experiment with different scikit-learn models or hyperparameters if desired
